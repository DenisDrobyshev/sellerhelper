"""Stage 3 — Size up competition.

Reads a niche's product snapshot and measures whether there is room to enter:
how concentrated the brands are, the price corridor, and where incumbents are
weak. "Weak incumbents" — popular products that buyers rate only so-so — are the
v0, data-grounded proxy for the unmet needs that become your angle.

`analyze_reviews` is the deeper review-NLP engine, ready to plug in once review
text is available (WB throttles the review API and hashes the review DOM — the
same data frontier the collectors already fight).

Gate: an entry window exists — the market is not saturated AND there is at least
one credible opening.
